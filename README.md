# Movie Recommender System

## Problem Description
This project involves building a movie recommendation system using a dataset of movies. The goal is to create a model that can recommend movies based on their similarity to a given movie. The model uses various features such as genres, keywords, cast, and crew to determine the similarity between movies.

## Project Goals
- Process and clean the movie dataset to extract useful features.
- Create a content-based recommendation system using cosine similarity.
- Implement the model in a Streamlit app to provide an interactive user interface for movie recommendations.

## Data Analysis Summary
This project consists of several key steps including data collection, preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and deployment. The major steps include:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values and duplicates.
- Feature extraction from movie metadata such as genres, keywords, cast, and crew.
- Vectorization and stemming of text data to create a similarity matrix.
- Building a recommendation function to suggest movies based on cosine similarity.
- Deploying the model using a Streamlit app for an interactive user experience.

## Hardware and Software Used
- **Hardware:** The analysis was performed on a personal computer with standard specifications.
- **Software:** 
  - Python 3.x
  - Jupyter Notebook
  - pandas
  - NumPy
  - NLTK
  - scikit-learn
  - Streamlit

## Overview of Python, pandas, and Other Technologies
- **Python:** The primary programming language used for data analysis and building the recommendation system.
- **pandas:** Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy:** Utilized for numerical operations.
- **NLTK:** Used for natural language processing, including stemming.
- **scikit-learn:** Employed for vectorization and calculating cosine similarity.
- **Streamlit:** Used for deploying the recommendation system as a web app.

## Detailed Explanation of Steps and Files
### Step 1: Importing Modules
Essential libraries and modules are imported to facilitate data analysis and model building.

### Step 2: Data Collection
The dataset is read into pandas DataFrames for analysis. The dataset includes movie metadata such as genres, keywords, cast, and crew.

### Step 3: Data Preprocessing
- **Handling Missing Values:** Missing values are identified and handled appropriately.
- **Dropping Duplicates:** Duplicate records are removed to ensure data quality.

### Step 4: Feature Extraction
- **Genres, Keywords, Cast, Crew:** These features are extracted and transformed into a list format.
- **Text Processing:** The text data is processed to remove spaces and convert to lowercase.

### Step 5: Vectorization and Stemming
- **Vectorization:** The text data is converted into numerical vectors using CountVectorizer.
- **Stemming:** Words are stemmed to their root form to standardize the text data.

### Step 6: Building the Recommendation Model
- **Cosine Similarity:** The cosine similarity between movie vectors is calculated to determine movie similarity.
- **Recommendation Function:** A function is created to recommend movies based on a given movie's similarity to others.

### Step 7: Model Saving
- **Pickle Files:** The model and necessary data are saved as pickle files for later use in the Streamlit app.

### Step 8: Deploying with Streamlit
- **app.py:** The Streamlit app file uses the saved model to provide an interactive user interface for movie recommendations.

## Data Collection Methodology
The data was collected from the TMDB 5000 dataset, which includes comprehensive metadata about movies such as genres, keywords, cast, and crew.

## Data Cleaning
Data cleaning involved removing missing values, dropping duplicates, and converting text data into a usable format. This step ensures the accuracy and reliability of the recommendation system.

## Visualization Creations
Visualizations are not a major component of this project, but the model's output is visualized interactively through the Streamlit app.

## Conclusion
The movie recommender system provides personalized movie recommendations based on content similarity. This system can be used by movie enthusiasts to discover new movies similar to their favorites.

## Future Steps and Improvements
- Include user ratings to create a hybrid recommendation system combining content-based and collaborative filtering.
- Expand the dataset to include more movies and metadata for improved recommendations.
- Enhance the Streamlit app with additional features such as filtering by genre or year.

This project demonstrates the application of data analysis and machine learning techniques to build a functional movie recommender system. The methodologies and tools used can be extended to other recommendation systems and datasets.
